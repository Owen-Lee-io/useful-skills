## Guidelines Demonstrated

These examples illustrate:

1. **Question Variety**: Different question types (what, when, how, define)
2. **Strategic Highlighting**: Use `[T#!!fbc0bc#()]` for technical terms, symbols, foreign words
3. **Smart Cloze Deletion**: Use `[F##]` for facts that need active recall
4. **Atomic Cards**: Each card tests one specific piece of knowledge
5. **Clear Organization**: Grouped by subject/chapter for easier review
6. **Balanced Markup**: Not every word needs highlighting - be selective
